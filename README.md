# Project2-TexasTimeline
Texas is a fascinating state, home to many interesting historical events. Through our application the user will see an interactive timeline in which historical events will be displayed. The user will be able to click on an event and receive blogs, videos, maps, and articles of what occurred on that date.


## Seeding the Database

You can seed the database with initial data using the `seed` module.

To run it, run `npm run seed` in the project's directory. Initial seed data comes from the seeds.json file.

It also asks you if you want to delete the database if it is not empty prior to seeding it to restart it.
